/**
 * Creates a subaccount in a global account or directory.
 *
 * __Tip:__
 * You must be assigned to the global account or directory admin role.
 *
 * __Further documentation:__
 * <https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/account-model>
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as btp from "@lechnerc77/pulumi-btp";
 * import * as btp from "@pulumi/btp";
 *
 * export = async () => {
 *     // create a subaccount in eu30 region (GCP)
 *     const myProject = new btp.Subaccount("myProject", {
 *         subdomain: "my-project",
 *         region: "eu30",
 *     });
 *     // create a subaccount in every Azure region which has support for cloud foundry
 *     const all = await btp.getRegions({});
 *     // create the subaccounts by iterating over the regions with the defined constraints
 *     const myProjectOnAzure: btp.Subaccount[] = [];
 *     for (const range of Object.entries(.filter(dc => dc.environment == "cloudfoundry" && dc.iaasProvider == "AZURE").reduce((__obj, dc) => ({ ...__obj, [dc.region]: dc }))).map(([k, v]) => ({key: k, value: v}))) {
 *         myProjectOnAzure.push(new btp.Subaccount(`myProjectOnAzure-${range.key}`, {
 *             subdomain: `my-project-${range.key}`,
 *             region: range.key,
 *         }));
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * terraform
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import btp:index/subaccount:Subaccount <resource_name> <subaccount_id>
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import btp:index/subaccount:Subaccount my_project 6aa64c2f-38c1-49a9-b2e8-cf9fea769b7f
